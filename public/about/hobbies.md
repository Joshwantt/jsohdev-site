# Hobbies

Here is a quick overview of what I have been up to outside of work or projects recently.

## Fitness

- Since late 2021, I've started taking my physical health more seriously.
- Have found enjoyment in weight lifting; I usually do this 3-6 times per week depending on my current goals.
- I don't do as much cardio as I probably should, but I have been making an effort to do 100-200 mins of cardio per week.
- Eating healthy and ensuring an appropriate caloric intake to meet my current goal has been an important contributor to progress.

## PC Gaming / SIM Racing

- In my downtime I enjoy SIM Racing or PC gaming.
- Dedicated SIM rig and VR headset for great immersion. Play mostly Assetto Corsa or Dirt Rally.
- Enjoy single-player or 'at your own pace' multiplayer games on my PC. RDR2, The Witcher 3, Runescape, and Cyberpunk are games I've been enjoying recently.

## Motorsport

- My housemates and I own an old BMW together which we have repaired and modified for taking to racetracks.
- Lots of continuing issues and it's a bit of a money pit, but solving the problems as a team and trying to improve the car for its desired use is fun.
- Originally drift-optimized for a small local track at Archerfield. This has been shut down, so some improvements are underway to make it better suit larger tracks.
- Shockingly good transfer of muscle memory from SIM Racing to real life.
