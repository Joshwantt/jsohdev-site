# Goals

Just some plans I have for this site, other projects, or personally over the coming months.

## Projects

### Low Power IoT Screen
- I've got an idea for a low-power IoT device, which has an e-ink screen for displaying customizable messages.
- The current design is an ESP32, which, utilizing the microcontroller's available deep-sleep states and low power demands of e-ink screens, aims to achieve an acceptably long time between recharges.
- At some specified interval, the device will wake up, request via API the current message it should display, and if needed update the e-ink screen.

### JsohDev extension to support IoT Screen

To support the IoT screen project, I intend to develop a web component to allow for the following:
- Account creation (MVP Done)
- Ability for users to 'register' a screen to their account (WIP)
- Ability for users to add/schedule messages through a calendar-like UI (WIP)
- API/Backend to facilitate WebUI and device functions (MVP/WIP)

## Personal Goals

### Fitness
- After a mass gaining period late last year, I'm in the progress of cutting back down in preparation for another massing phase.
- Want to mix up my weight training to better reflect new research findings, and to experiment with some different movements.
- Want to get into rock climbing.

### Traveling
- I want to go somewhere; I'm not sure where yet - only criteria is that it must be cold.
